# Project Two
by: Isa Jimenez

# Project Overview

This website and its themes are based around a very popular song called "we fell in love in october" by the singer girl in red. The main point of this project is to evoke a sense of belonging that can be recalled during the fall and winter months.I chose a warmer color palette that I found reminded me of the autumn months.
